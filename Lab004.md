# LAB004 - Reverse Polish notation calculator

*deadline: 1 week*

We will cover:
1. Parser combinators

Write "Reverse Polish notation calculator". Program runs forever where it:
1. promts user for the input expression (written in [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation))
2. reads user input
3. evaluates user input:
a) if it is a valid expression, it will evaluate its value
b) if it is an invalid input (not an expression) then it will warn user about it

Example:

```
> 10 20 +
30
> 100 80 -
20
> 10 2 /
5
> 10 sdfsd /
Could not evaluate '10 sdfsd /'
```
