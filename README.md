# Haskell-University
Portfolio-based approach to learning Haskell

## Exercises 

### 1. Hello World 

*deadline: 1 week*

1. Write program that prints out "Hello worlds" and terminates
2. Write program that welcomes user, asks for his/her name, greets user and terminates
3. Write program that will run program 2. in an infinte loop


## Ideas for future exercises

### Simple calculator (I think I heard that already from someone ;) )

### Simple language parser (could be an extension of above [Polish notation maybe?])

### CRUD logic
Create program holding some CRUD logic (like Library where you can borrow, return, remove and list all books).
### Simple CRUD http server with Servant (https://haskell-servant.github.io/)
### Simple CRUD web application with YASOD
### Something with concurrent programming using threads
### Usage of MVar
### Learning Free by creating file system abstraction (FSA)
### Implement FSA for Hadoop
### Implement FSA for ElasticSearch
### Implement FSA for Postgress
### Implement FSA for Cassandra
### distributed-process
- implement ping-pong
- implement chat server
