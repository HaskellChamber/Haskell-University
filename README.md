Portfolio-based approach to learning Haskell

## New semster just started!

First edition of Haskell University just started! You can join by adding your name to the list of students with a link to the repository where you will push your solutions to the exercies.

## Exercises 

### 1. Hello World 

*deadline: 1 week*

We will cover:
1. How to init new Haskell project
2. using the `IO` type
3. divide project to modules

Write program that:

1. Write program that prints out "Hello worlds" and terminates

```
$ stack exec exercise1-exe
Hello World
```

2. Write program that welcomes user, asks for his/her name, greets user and terminates

```
$ stack exec exercise1-exe
Hello, what is your name?
Pawel
Nice to meet you Pawel
```

3. Write program that will run program 2. in an infinte loop

```
$ stack exec exercise1-exe
Hello, what is your name?
Pawel
Nice to meet you Pawel
Hello, what is your name?
Mike
Nice to meet you Mike
Hello, what is your name?
Kate
Nice to meet you Kate
Hello, what is your name?
```

*hints*: 
import Control.Monad (forever)

### 2. Reverse Polish notation calculator

*deadline: 1 week*

We will cover:
1. Parser combinators

Write "Reverse Polish notation calculator". Program runs forever where it:
1. promts user for the input expression (written in [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
2. reads user input
3. evaluates user input:
a) if it is a valid expression, it will evaluate its value
b) if it is an invalid input (not an expression) then it will warn user about it

Example:

```
> 10 20 +
30
> 100 80 -
20
> 10 2 /
5
> 10 sdfsd /
Could not evaluate '10 sdfsd /'
```

*Reading material:*

1. ["Learn you a Haskell" on Reverse Polish notation](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functionally-solving-problems)
2. "Haskell - Programming from first Principles" by Ch.Allen & J.Moronuki chapter 24 "Parser Combinators"
3. "Programming Haskell" by Graham Hutton, chapter 8 "Functional Parsers"

### 3. Advanced Calculator

*deadline: 1 week*

We will cover:
1. State monad

Add new feature to the calculator you implemented in Exercise 2. This time each time you evaluate an expression, its value is printed out along the name of the variable that will hold its value. That variable can be used in further calculations.

Example:

```
> 20 10 +
res0: 30
> 100 res0 -
res1: 70
> res1 res50 /
Could not evaluate 'res1 res50 /'
```

## Ideas for future exercises
### CRUD logic
Create program holding some CRUD logic (like Library where you can borrow, return, remove and list all books).
### Simple CRUD http server with Servant (https://haskell-servant.github.io/)
### Simple CRUD web application with YASOD
### Something with concurrent programming using threads
### Usage of MVar
### Learning Free by creating file system abstraction (FSA)
### Implement FSA for Hadoop
### Implement FSA for ElasticSearch
### Implement FSA for Postgress
### Implement FSA for Cassandra
### distributed-process
- implement ping-pong
- implement chat server
