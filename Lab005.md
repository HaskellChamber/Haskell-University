# LAB005 - Advanced Calculator

*deadline: 1 week*

We will cover:
1. State monad

Add new feature to the calculator you implemented in Exercise 4. This time each time you evaluate an expression, its value is printed out along with the name of the variable that will hold its value. That variable can be used in further calculations.

Example:

```
> 20 10 +
res0: 30
> 100 res0 -
res1: 70
> res1 res50 /
Could not evaluate 'res1 res50 /'
```


### FAQ

#### 1. Will you provide lectures notes?
Originally Haskell University's intent is to provide challenges, problems to solve. It's the students responsibility to explore the topic on his/her own. However 
1. occasionally we will point to book chapters, blog posts as hints for the exercies
2. we encourage the community to post solutions to the problems (via blogposts, gists, repositories, youtube videos), we will be more then happy to include them as solutions along the exercies. 

#### 2. I'm senior Haskell developer, can I help?
Yes! We need your help. We need experienced Haskell developers to create exercies for us, to challange students. If you have an idea for an exercise, please submit an issue or add it directly as a pull request to this README.md
