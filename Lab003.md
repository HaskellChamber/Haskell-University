# LAB003 - Apples and oranges

*deadline: 1 week*

Programs:

### Shopping cart

1. You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
2. Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
3. Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost
    For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05

### Simple offers

The shop decides to introduce two new offers 
* buy one, get one free on Apples 
* 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges

Update your checkout functions accordingly

### QuickCheck

You can use QuickCheck to verify that the price after applying promotion is lower than before promotion (you can leverage custom generators if you used instances for Apple and Orange).
